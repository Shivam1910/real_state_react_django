# Real Estate App using React as Frontend and Django as Backend by Shivam Shrivastava

## Steps to Run the Application

Pull the repository into your device and run it as you used to run Django Application.

- (You need to install 'requirements.txt' if you don't have these already)

- (You also need to build React Application as it has been ignored in git and also need node_modules.)

### 1. Home Page

When you first open the application, you will see the home page where you can see the search options and default search results just below. You will see two menu icons (One at right top and another at left top).
